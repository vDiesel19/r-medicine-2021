		- header_2: Platform & Specifications
			text_1: '<p>We will be using the virtual event platform CrowdCast that will allow speakers to deliver content live or by pre-recorded talk, and join live for Q&A during the session.</p><p>Posters will be presented on SpatialChat, a platform that allows participants to interact as video and audio-enabled avatars in a virtual room. To move within a room, use your mouse and drag your avatar to a new location. Avatars who are close to each other can hear one another, so much like in real life, you hear people who are close to you but not those who are further away. To get a better sense of this experience, you can test SpatialChat <a href="https://spatial.chat/s/rmed21test" target="_blank">here.</a></p>'

			text_1: '<p>As with physical events, live interaction is essential to the success of virtual events and we are asking every presenter, whether presenting live or via pre-recorded session, to join for live chat with attendees during their session, within the platform. This will provide added value to the audience and create more of an 'event' experience.</p><p>If you are concerned about your timezone and how that could impact the live Q&A portion of your session, we will do our best to reschedule your session slot to a time that is convenient for you.</p>'

		- header_2: Technical Tips for Virtual Presentations
			text_1: ''
			list_items:
				- '<span>Audio</span> – as counterintuitive as it may sound, the single most important factor in a good video, is the audio quality.'
				- '<span>Eliminate ambient noise</span> – close the doors and windows. You'd be surprised how much environmental noise gets picked up.'
				- '<span>Lighting</span> – Do not put lights overhead and don't put any lights or windows behind you as they will alter the light levels in your videos and create shadows.'
				- '<span>Background</span> – don't be afraid to show your natural environment – bookcases, plants, paintings – as long as they are not too distracting.'
				- '<span>Framing</span> – place yourself slightly off-center to the left or right rather than directly in the middle of the frame.'
				- '<span>Camera Height</span> – the lens should either be directly level or pointing ever so slightly downwards towards your face.'
				- '<span>Stand</span> – we recommend you stand during your presentation to help project your voice and improve your posture. However, if you're more comfortable sitting, then please do.'
				- '<span>Timer</span> – Have a clock to keep track of the time you have remaining.'

		- header_2: Lighting, Webcam and Microphone Best Practices
			text_1: ''
			list_items: ''
			sub_section:
				- header_3: Best Practices for Lighting
					items:
						- 'For best results, use natural light and supplement with additional light as needed.'
						- 'Keep natural light in front of you to avoid shadows. A bright window behind you can make you appear as a dark silhouette.'
						- 'Interior rooms with no natural light source may require additional targeted lighting, such as a ring light, to brighten the speaker's face.'
				- header_3: Best Practices for Webcams
					items:
						- 'To ensure the speaker is looking directly at the audience, place the webcam at eye level.'
						- 'Avoid distracting backgrounds by checking the surroundings behind you to make sure there are no distracting colors or movement.'
						- 'Presenters should use chairs that are adjustable for height but do not swivel. Swiveling on camera creates a poor attendee experience and can be distracting.'
				- header_3: Best Practices for Microphones
					items:
						- 'Use external microphones whenever available, as microphones built into computers and cameras often have lower quality.'
						- 'An external microphone allows the speaker to place it in the optimal location for sound.'
						- 'Place the microphone close to the speaker's mouth, but not in the camera view.'
						- 'Test audio levels in advance.'
						- 'Manage noise by turning off fans, phones, or speakers and keep ambient noise to a minimum.'
						- 'Do not touch the microphone while unmuted'
				- header_3: Dress Code
			text_2: '<p>There is no dress code for presentations, and we encourage you to be comfortable. That said, you must be aware that the <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> applies to this space, both in terms of what you show on camera and what you say. We ask that you be tasteful and considerate in choosing your clothing and surroundings. Keep in mind that we are a global community. Please refrain from wearing shirts with global brand logos that are not your own. Solid colors (not white) also work best instead of prints.</p>'
