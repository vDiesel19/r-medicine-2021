text_section_1: "We are happy to announce that we were able to significantly reduce our registration fees! In addition, we again offer heavily discounted rates for Academic and Student/Trainee registrants. Please see below for details."
text_section_2: "Registration includes full access to the live conference, as well as recordings of talks and workshops. These will be made available as soon as possible after the conference. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee live participation in workshops, because seats are limited. Workshop registrations will be sent to registered conference participants prior to the conference. Early registration will increase your chance of being selected for a seat! <strong>Note that ALL participants will receive access to ALL workshop materials, including recordings of workshops, where allowed.</strong>"
