text_section_1: "We are happy to announce that we were able to significantly reduce our registration fees! In addition, we again offer heavily discounted rates for Academic and Student/Trainee registrants. Please see below for details."
text_section_2: "Registration includes full access to the live conference as well as recordings of talks and workshops which will be made available as soon as possible after the conference. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee live participation in workshops as seats are limited. Workshop registrations will be sent to registered conference participants prior to the conference and, depending on level of interest, may need to be allocated by lottery, potentially weighted by metrics designed to promote equity. <strong>Please note that ALL participants will receive access to all workshop materials including recordings of workshops, where allowed.</strong>"
