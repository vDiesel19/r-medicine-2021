 - text: R is a free and open-source programming language for reproducible statistical computing, data visualization, and application development. R is the gold standard for reproducible research in academia and industry and has powerful capabilities to create highly-customizable interactive analytic dashboards, as well as predictive models that employ machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.
 - text: R/Medicine was formed through a collaborative effort of the R Consortium with academic and industry partners including Yale University, Stanford University, the Mayo Clinic, and RStudio, PBC. Presentations at R/Medicine conferences showcase how the R ecosystem is currently leveraged in medical applications including clinical trial design and analysis, personalized medicine, the development of machine learning models using patient record and clinical laboratory data, and reproducible research.
